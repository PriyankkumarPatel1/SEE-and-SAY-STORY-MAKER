<ul>
  <li>In this user can press on different button to genereate noun, verb and adjective for sentence.</li>
  <li>Random selection will be done from the list and stored in memory, while pressing button on the top of the list.</li>
  <li>After Pressing <h2>Read the Story</h2> button, application will tell you the story you have just created.</li>
  <li>If user wants to listen random story, this option also available from <h2>Random Story</h2> button.</li>
